# Pure types implementation of a snake game
This is a snake game implemented using types alone. To start the game open index.ts and start typing awsd into the `helloworld` string.
These are treated as a classic game controls.

`S` symbols represent snake, `X` is food.
Like in the original, snake goes around and eats food that makes it grow, once food is eaten, new one is generated in a random spot.


The whole game is written using TypeScript's types alone, without any classic programming code.
